ABOUT THE GAME

RENEGADE is an original bullet hell shooter, including a hand-built bullet hell level engine, made by Kevin Ding. A love letter to bullet hell games through the years, from THUNDER FORCE to STRIKERS1945.

All code, gameplay systems, and music were created with love — and some patience.
Sprites and sound effects were created with OpenAI's ChatGPT 4o.
